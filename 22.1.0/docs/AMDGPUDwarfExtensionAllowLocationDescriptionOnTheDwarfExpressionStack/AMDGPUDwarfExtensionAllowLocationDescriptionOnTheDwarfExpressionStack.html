<section id="extension">
<h1>1. Extension<a class="headerlink" href="#extension" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>In DWARF 5, expressions are evaluated using a typed value stack, a separate
location area, and an independent loclist mechanism. This extension unifies all
three mechanisms into a single generalized DWARF expression evaluation model
that allows both typed values and location descriptions to be manipulated on the
evaluation stack. Both single and multiple location descriptions are supported
on the stack. In addition, the call frame information (CFI) is extended to
support the full generality of location descriptions. This is done in a manner
that is backwards compatible with DWARF 5. The extension involves changes to the
DWARF 5 sections 2.5 (pp 26-38), 2.6 (pp 38-45), and 6.4 (pp 171-182).</p>
<p>The extension permits operations to act on location descriptions in an
incremental, consistent, and composable manner. It allows a small number of
operations to be defined to address the requirements of heterogeneous devices as
well as providing benefits to non-heterogeneous devices. It acts as a foundation
to provide support for other issues that have been raised that would benefit all
devices.</p>
<p>Other approaches were explored that involved adding specialized operations and
rules. However, these resulted in the need for more operations that did not
compose. It also resulted in operations with context sensitive semantics and
corner cases that had to be defined. The observation was that numerous
specialized context sensitive operations are harder for both producers and
consumers than a smaller number of general composable operations that have
consistent semantics regardless of context.</p>
<p>First, section <a class="reference internal" href="#heterogeneous-computing-devices">2. Heterogeneous Computing Devices</a>
describes heterogeneous devices and the features they have that are not addressed by DWARF 5.
Then section <a class="reference internal" href="#dwarf-5">3. DWARF5</a> presents a brief simplified overview of the DWARF 5 expression
evaluation model that highlights the difficulties for supporting the
heterogeneous features. Next, section <a class="reference internal" href="#extension-solution">4. Extension
Solution</a> provides an overview of the proposal, using
simplified examples to illustrate how it can address the issues of heterogeneous
devices and also benefit non-heterogeneous devices. Then overall conclusions are
covered in section <a class="reference internal" href="#conclusion">5. Conclusion</a>.
Appendix <a class="reference internal" href="#a-changes-to-dwarf-debugging-information-format-version-5">A. Changes to DWARF Debugging Information Format Version 5</a> gives changes
relative to the DWARF Version 5 standard. Finally, appendix
<a class="reference internal" href="#b-further-information">B. Further Information</a> has references to further information.</p>

<section id="heterogeneous-computing-devices">
<h1>2. Heterogeneous Computing Devices<a class="headerlink" href="#heterogeneous-computing-devices" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>GPUs and other heterogeneous computing devices have features not common to CPU
computing devices.</p>
<p>These devices often have many more registers than a CPU. This helps reduce
memory accesses which tend to be more expensive than on a CPU due to the much
larger number of threads concurrently executing. In addition to traditional
scalar registers of a CPU, these devices often have many wide vector registers.</p>
<p><img alt="Example GPU Hardware" src="../_images/example-gpu-hardware.png" /></p>
<p>They may support masked vector instructions that are used by the compiler to map
high level language threads onto the lanes of the vector registers. As a
consequence, multiple language threads execute in lockstep as the vector
instructions are executed. This is termed single instruction multiple thread
(SIMT) execution.</p>
<p><img alt="SIMT/SIMD Execution Model" src="../_images/simt-execution-model.png" /></p>
<p>GPUs can have multiple memory address spaces in addition to the single global
memory address space of a CPU. These additional address spaces are accessed
using distinct instructions and are often local to a particular thread or group
of threads.</p>
<p>For example, a GPU may have a per thread block address space that is implemented
as scratch pad memory with explicit hardware support to isolate portions to
specific groups of threads created as a single thread block.</p>
<p>A GPU may also use global memory in a non linear manner. For example, to support
providing a SIMT per lane address space efficiently, there may be instructions
that support interleaved access.</p>
<p>Through optimization, the source variables may be located across these different
storage kinds. SIMT execution requires locations to be able to express selection
of runtime defined pieces of vector registers. With the more complex locations,
there is a benefit to be able to factorize their calculation which requires all
location kinds to be supported uniformly, otherwise duplication is necessary.</p>

<section id="how-dwarf-maps-source-language-to-hardware">
<h2>3.1 How DWARF Maps Source Language To Hardware<a class="headerlink" href="#how-dwarf-maps-source-language-to-hardware" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>DWARF is a standardized way to specify debug information. It describes source
language entities such as compilation units, functions, types, variables, etc.
It is either embedded directly in sections of the code object executables, or
split into separate files that they reference.</p>
<p>DWARF maps between source program language entities and their hardware
representations. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It maps a hardware instruction program counter to a source language program
line, and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>It maps a source language function to the hardware instruction program counter
for its entry point.</p></li>
<li><p>It maps a source language variable to its hardware location when at a
particular program counter.</p></li>
<li><p>It provides information to allow virtual unwinding of hardware registers for a
source language function call stack.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, it provides numerous other information about the source language
program.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, there is great diversity in the way a source language entity
could be mapped to a hardware location. The location may involve runtime values.
For example, a source language variable location could be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In register.</p></li>
<li><p>At a memory address.</p></li>
<li><p>At an offset from the current stack pointer.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimized away, but with a known compiler time value.</p></li>
<li><p>Optimized away, but with an unknown value, such as happens for unused
variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Spread across combination of the above kinds of locations.</p></li>
<li><p>At a memory address, but also transiently loaded into registers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To support this DWARF 5 defines a rich expression language comprised of loclist
expressions and operation expressions. Loclist expressions allow the result to
vary depending on the PC. Operation expressions are made up of a list of
operations that are evaluated on a simple stack machine.</p>
<p>A DWARF expression can be used as the value of different attributes of different
debug information entries (DIE). A DWARF expression can also be used as an
argument to call frame information information (CFI) entry operations. An
expression is evaluated in a context dictated by where it is used. The context
may include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Whether the expression needs to produce a value or the location of an entity.</p></li>
<li><p>The current execution point including process, thread, PC, and stack frame.</p></li>
<li><p>Some expressions are evaluated with the stack initialized with a specific
value or with the location of a base object that is available using the
DW_OP_push_object_address operation.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="examples">
<h2>3.2 Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following examples illustrate how DWARF expressions involving operations are
evaluated in DWARF 5. DWARF also has expressions involving location lists that
are not covered in these examples.</p>
<section id="dynamic-array-size">
<h3>3.2.1 Dynamic Array Size<a class="headerlink" href="#dynamic-array-size" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first example is for an operation expression associated with a DIE attribute
that provides the number of elements in a dynamic array type. Such an attribute
dictates that the expression must be evaluated in the context of providing a
value result kind.</p>
<p><img alt="Dynamic Array Size Example" src="../_images/01-value.example.png" /></p>
<p>In this hypothetical example, the compiler has allocated an array descriptor in
memory and placed the descriptor’s address in architecture register SGPR0. The
first location of the array descriptor is the runtime size of the array.</p>
<p>A possible expression to retrieve the dynamic size of the array is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regval_type SGPR0 Generic
DW_OP_deref
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The expression is evaluated one operation at a time. Operations have operands
and can pop and push entries on a stack.</p>
<p><img alt="Dynamic Array Size Example: Step 1" src="../_images/01-value.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>The expression evaluation starts with the first DW_OP_regval_type operation.
This operation reads the current value of an architecture register specified by
its first operand: SGPR0. The second operand specifies the size of the data to
read. The read value is pushed on the stack. Each stack element is a value and
its associated type.</p>
<p><img alt="Dynamic Array Size Example: Step 2" src="../_images/01-value.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>The type must be a DWARF base type. It specifies the encoding, byte ordering,
and size of values of the type. DWARF defines that each architecture has a
default generic type: it is an architecture specific integral encoding and byte
ordering, that is the size of the architecture’s global memory address.</p>
<p>The DW_OP_deref operation pops a value off the stack, treats it as a global
memory address, and reads the contents of that location using the generic type.
It pushes the read value on the stack as the value and its associated generic
type.</p>
<p><img alt="Dynamic Array Size Example: Step 3" src="../_images/01-value.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p>The evaluation stops when it reaches the end of the expression. The result of an
expression that is evaluated with a value result kind context is the top element
of the stack, which provides the value and its type.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-location-in-register">
<h3>3.2.2 Variable Location in Register<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-location-in-register" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example is for an operation expression associated with a DIE attribute that
provides the location of a source language variable. Such an attribute dictates
that the expression must be evaluated in the context of providing a location
result kind.</p>
<p>DWARF defines the locations of objects in terms of location descriptions.</p>
<p>In this example, the compiler has allocated a source language variable in
architecture register SGPR0.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Register Example" src="../_images/02-reg.example.png" /></p>
<p>A possible expression to specify the location of the variable is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regx SGPR0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Register Example: Step 1" src="../_images/02-reg.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_regx operation creates a location description that specifies the
location of the architecture register specified by the operand: SGPR0. Unlike
values, location descriptions are not pushed on the stack. Instead they are
conceptually placed in a location area. Unlike values, location descriptions do
not have an associated type, they only denote the location of the base of the
object.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Register Example: Step 2" src="../_images/02-reg.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>Again, evaluation stops when it reaches the end of the expression. The result of
an expression that is evaluated with a location result kind context is the
location description in the location area.</p>
</section>
<section id="variable-location-in-memory">
<h3>3.2.3 Variable Location in Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-location-in-memory" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next example is for an operation expression associated with a DIE attribute
that provides the location of a source language variable that is allocated in a
stack frame. The compiler has placed the stack frame pointer in architecture
register SGPR0, and allocated the variable at offset 0x10 from the stack frame
base. The stack frames are allocated in global memory, so SGPR0 contains a
global memory address.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Memory Example" src="../_images/03-memory.example.png" /></p>
<p>A possible expression to specify the location of the variable is:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regval_type SGPR0 Generic
DW_OP_plus_uconst 0x10
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Memory Example: Step 1" src="../_images/03-memory.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>As in the previous example, the DW_OP_regval_type operation pushes the stack
frame pointer global memory address onto the stack. The generic type is the size
of a global memory address.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Memory Example: Step 2" src="../_images/03-memory.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_plus_uconst operation pops a value from the stack, which must have a
type with an integral encoding, adds the value of its operand, and pushes the
result back on the stack with the same associated type. In this example, that
computes the global memory address of the source language variable.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Memory Example: Step 3" src="../_images/03-memory.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p>Evaluation stops when it reaches the end of the expression. If the expression
that is evaluated has a location result kind context, and the location area is
empty, then the top stack element must be a value with the generic type. The
value is implicitly popped from the stack, and treated as a global memory
address to create a global memory location description, which is placed in the
location area. The result of the expression is the location description in the
location area.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Location in Memory Example: Step 4" src="../_images/03-memory.example.frame.4.png" /></p>

<section id="variable-spread-across-different-locations">
<h3>3.2.4 Variable Spread Across Different Locations<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-spread-across-different-locations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example is for a source variable that is partly in a register, partly undefined, and partly in memory.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example" src="../_images/04-composite.example.png" /></p>
<p>DWARF defines composite location descriptions that can have one or more parts.
Each part specifies a location description and the number of bytes used from it.
The following operation expression creates a composite location description.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regx SGPR3
DW_OP_piece 4
DW_OP_piece 2
DW_OP_bregx SGPR0 0x10
DW_OP_piece 2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 1" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_regx operation creates a register location description in the location
area.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 2" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>The first DW_OP_piece operation creates an incomplete composite location
description in the location area with a single part. The location description in
the location area is used to define the beginning of the part for the size
specified by the operand, namely 4 bytes.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 3" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p>A subsequent DW_OP_piece adds a new part to an incomplete composite location
description already in the location area. The parts form a contiguous set of
bytes. If there are no other location descriptions in the location area, and no
value on the stack, then the part implicitly uses the undefined location
description. Again, the operand specifies the size of the part in bytes. The
undefined location description can be used to indicate a part that has been
optimized away. In this case, 2 bytes of undefined value.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 4" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.4.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_bregx operation reads the architecture register specified by the first
operand (SGPR0) as the generic type, adds the value of the second operand
(0x10), and pushes the value on the stack.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 5" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.5.png" /></p>
<p>The next DW_OP_piece operation adds another part to the already created
incomplete composite location.</p>
<p>If there is no other location in the location area, but there is a value on
stack, the new part is a memory location description. The memory address used is
popped from the stack. In this case, the operand of 2 indicates there are 2
bytes from memory.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 6" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.6.png" /></p>
<p>Evaluation stops when it reaches the end of the expression. If the expression
that is evaluated has a location result kind context, and the location area has
an incomplete composite location description, the incomplete composite location
is implicitly converted to a complete composite location description. The result
of the expression is the location description in the location area.</p>
<p><img alt="Variable Spread Across Different Locations Example: Step 7" src="../_images/04-composite.example.frame.7.png" /></p>
</section>
<section id="offsetting-a-composite-location">
<h3>3.2.5 Offsetting a Composite Location<a class="headerlink" href="#offsetting-a-composite-location" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This example attempts to extend the previous example to offset the composite
location description it created. The <a class="reference internal" href="#variable-location-in-memory">3.2.3 Variable Location in
Memory</a> example conveniently used the DW_OP_plus
operation to offset a memory address.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regx SGPR3
DW_OP_piece 4
DW_OP_piece 2
DW_OP_bregx SGPR0 0x10
DW_OP_piece 2
DW_OP_plus_uconst 5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Offsetting a Composite Location Example: Step 6" src="../_images/05-composite-plus.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>However, DW_OP_plus cannot be used to offset a composite location. It only
operates on the stack.</p>
<p><img alt="Offsetting a Composite Location Example: Step 7" src="../_images/05-composite-plus.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>To offset a composite location description, the compiler would need to make a
different composite location description, starting at the part corresponding to
the offset. For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_piece 1
DW_OP_bregx SGPR0 0x10
DW_OP_piece 2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This illustrates that operations on stack values are not composable with
operations on location descriptions.</p>

<section id="pointer-to-member">
<h3>3.2.6 Pointer to Member<a class="headerlink" href="#pointer-to-member" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: Without loss of generality, DWARF 4 is used in this example as full
support for DWARF 5 is not present in the versions of the tools used. No
feature of DWARF 5 provides a remedy for this issue.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This example highlights the inability of DWARF 5 to describe C++
pointer-to-member use semantics.</p>
<p>The mechanism DWARF 5 provides for describing pointer-to-member use is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_use_location</span></code>, which is defined as encoding a location description which
computes the address of the member pointed to by a pointer-to-member, given the
pointer-to-member object and the address of the containing object.</p>
<p>That is, when a debug agent wishes to evaluate a pointer-to-member access
operation, it first pushes two values onto the DWARF expression stack:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The pointer-to-member object</p></li>
<li><p>The address of the containing object</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It then evaluates the location description associated with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_use_location</span></code> of the pointer-to-member type, and interprets the result
as the address of the member pointed to by the pointer-to-member.</p>
<p>Consider the following C++ source file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s.cc</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-cpp notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">s</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>

<p>The expression <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_plus</span></code> accurately describes this implementation so long as
the entire containing object resides in memory in the default address space.</p>
<p>However, what if the containing object or the member pointed to are not at any
default address space address?</p>
<p>The compiler may store the containing object in memory in any address space,
in a register, recompute its value at each use, or compose any of these in
arbitrary ways.</p>
<p>The richness of the existing DWARF 5 expression language is a reflection of the
diversity of possible implementation strategies and optimization choices
affecting the location of an object in a program, and (modulo address spaces)
it can describe all of these locations for variables. However, the moment we
look at a pointer-to-member use we are restricted to only objects residing in a
contiguous piece of memory in the default address space.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the problem, consider a program which GCC chooses to optimize in
such a way that the containing object is not in memory at all:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: Without loss of generality, DWARF 4 is used in this example as full
support for DWARF 5 is not present in the versions of the tools used. No
feature of DWARF 5 provides a remedy for this issue.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This example highlights the inability of DWARF 5 to describe C++
virtual inheritance semantics.</p>
<p>The mechanism DWARF 5 provides for describing the location of an inherited
subobject is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_data_member_location</span></code>. This attribute is overloaded to
describe both data member locations and inherited subobject locations, and
in each case has multiple possible forms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If an integral constant form, it encodes the byte offset from the derived
object to the data member or subobject.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, it encodes a location description to compute the address of the
data member or subobject given the address of the derived object.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Only the attribute describing a subobject, and only the location description
form are considered here.</p>
<p>In this case, when a debug agent wishes to locate the subobject, it first
pushes the address of the derived object onto the DWARF expression stack. It
then evaluates the location description associated with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_data_member_location</span></code> of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_TAG_inheritence</span></code> DIE corresponding to
the inherited subobject.</p>

<p>That is, the address of an object of class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code> is equivalent to the address for
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vtable</span></code> pointer for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>. As there are no other direct data members of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code>
the primary base class subobject of class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code> comes next, and there is no
intervening padding as the subobject alignment requirements are already
satisfied.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vtable</span></code> pointer for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code> contains an entry <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vbase_offset</span></code> for each virtual

<p>That is, to find the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vbase_offset</span></code> for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span></code>-in-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">B</span></code> subobject the address
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vptr</span> <span class="pre">B</span></code> is offset by the statically determined value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-24</span></code>.</p>

<h2>3.3 Limitations<a class="headerlink" href="#limitations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>DWARF 5 is unable to describe variables in runtime indexed parts of registers.
This is required to describe a source variable that is located in a lane of a
SIMT vector register.</p>
<p>Some features only work when located in global memory. The type attribute
expressions require a base object which could be in any kind of location.</p>
<p>DWARF procedures can only accept global memory address arguments. This limits
the ability to factorize the creation of locations that involve other location
kinds.</p>
<p>There are no vector base types. This is required to describe vector registers.</p>
<p>There is no operation to create a memory location in a non-global address space.
Only the dereference operation supports providing an address space.</p>
<p>CFI location expressions do not allow composite locations or non-global address
space memory locations. Both these are needed in optimized code for devices with
vector registers and address spaces.</p>
<p>Bit field offsets are only supported in a limited way for register locations.
Supporting them in a uniform manner for all location kinds is required to
support languages with bit sized entities.</p>

<h1>4. Extension Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#extension-solution" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section outlines the extension to generalize the DWARF expression evaluation

a number of simplified examples to demonstrate the benefits and how the extension
solves the issues of heterogeneous devices. It presents how this is done in

<section id="location-description">
<h2>4.1 Location Description<a class="headerlink" href="#location-description" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to have consistent, composable operations that act on location
descriptions, the extension defines a uniform way to handle all location kinds.
That includes memory, register, implicit, implicit pointer, undefined, and
composite location descriptions.</p>
<p>Each kind of location description is conceptually a zero-based offset within a
piece of storage. The storage is a contiguous linear organization of a certain
number of bytes (see below for how this is extended to support bit sized
storage).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For global memory, the storage is the linear stream of bytes of the
architecture’s address size.</p></li>
<li><p>For each separate architecture register, it is the linear stream of bytes of
the size of that specific register.</p></li>
<li><p>For an implicit, it is the linear stream of bytes of the value when

and byte ordering.</p></li>
<li><p>For undefined, it is an infinitely sized linear stream where every byte is
undefined.</p></li>

<section id="stack-location-description-operations">
<h2>4.2 Stack Location Description Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#stack-location-description-operations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DWARF expression stack is extended to allow each stack entry to either be a
value or a location description.</p>
<p>Evaluation rules are defined to implicitly convert a stack element that is a
value to a location description, or vice versa, so that all DWARF 5 expressions
continue to have the same semantics. This reflects that a memory address is
effectively used as a proxy for a memory location description.</p>
<p>For each place that allows a DWARF expression to be specified, it is defined if
the expression is to be evaluated as a value or a location description.</p>
<p>Existing DWARF expression operations that are used to act on memory addresses
are generalized to act on any location description kind. For example, the
DW_OP_deref operation pops a location description rather than a memory address
value from the stack and reads the storage associated with the location kind
starting at the location description’s offset.</p>
<p>Existing DWARF expression operations that create location descriptions are
changed to pop and push location descriptions on the stack. For example, the
DW_OP_value, DW_OP_regx, DW_OP_implicit_value, DW_OP_implicit_pointer,
DW_OP_stack_value, and DW_OP_piece.</p>
<p>New operations that act on location descriptions can be added. For example, a
DW_OP_offset operation that modifies the offset of the location description on
top of the stack. Unlike the DW_OP_plus operation that only works with memory
address, a DW_OP_offset operation can work with any location kind.</p>
<p>To allow incremental and nested creation of composite location descriptions, a
DW_OP_piece_end can be defined to explicitly indicate the last part of a
composite. Currently, creating a composite must always be the last operation of
an expression.</p>
<p>A DW_OP_undefined operation can be defined that explicitly creates the undefined
location description. Currently this is only possible as a piece of a composite
when the stack is empty.</p>

<h2>4.3 Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section provides some motivating examples to illustrate the benefits that
result from allowing location descriptions on the stack.</p>
<section id="source-language-variable-spilled-to-part-of-a-vector-register">
<h3>4.3.1 Source Language Variable Spilled to Part of a Vector Register<a class="headerlink" href="#source-language-variable-spilled-to-part-of-a-vector-register" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A compiler generating code for a GPU may allocate a source language variable
that it proves has the same value for every lane of a SIMT thread in a scalar
register. It may then need to spill that scalar register. To avoid the high cost
of spilling to memory, it may spill to a fixed lane of one of the numerous
vector registers.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spilled to Part of a Vector Register Example" src="../_images/06-extension-spill-sgpr-to-static-vpgr-lane.example.png" /></p>
<p>The following expression defines the location of a source language variable that
the compiler allocated in a scalar register, but had to spill to lane 5 of a
vector register at this point of the code.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regx VGPR0
DW_OP_offset_uconst 20
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spilled to Part of a Vector Register Example: Step 1" src="../_images/06-extension-spill-sgpr-to-static-vpgr-lane.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_regx pushes a register location description on the stack. The storage
for the register is the size of the vector register. The register location
description conceptually references that storage with an initial offset of 0.
The architecture defines the byte ordering of the register.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spilled to Part of a Vector Register Example: Step 2" src="../_images/06-extension-spill-sgpr-to-static-vpgr-lane.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_offset_uconst pops a location description off the stack, adds its
operand value to the offset, and pushes the updated location description back on
the stack. In this case the source language variable is being spilled to lane 5
and each lane’s component which is 32-bits (4 bytes), so the offset is 5*4=20.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spilled to Part of a Vector Register Example: Step 3" src="../_images/06-extension-spill-sgpr-to-static-vpgr-lane.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p>The result of the expression evaluation is the location description on the top
of the stack.</p>
<p>An alternative approach could be for the target to define distinct register
names for each part of each vector register. However, this is not practical for
GPUs due to the sheer number of registers that would have to be defined. It
would also not permit a runtime index into part of the whole register to be used
as shown in the next example.</p>

<h3>4.3.2 Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers<a class="headerlink" href="#source-language-variable-spread-across-multiple-vector-registers" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A compiler may generate SIMT code for a GPU. Each source language thread of
execution is mapped to a single lane of the GPU thread. Source language
variables that are mapped to a register, are mapped to the lane component of the
vector registers corresponding to the source language’s thread of execution.</p>
<p>The location expression for such variables must therefore be executed in the
context of the focused source language thread of execution. A DW_OP_push_lane
operation can be defined to push the value of the lane for the currently focused
source language thread of execution. The value to use would be provided by the
consumer of DWARF when it evaluates the location expression.</p>
<p>If the source language variable is larger than the size of the vector register
lane component, then multiple vector registers are used. Each source language
thread of execution will only use the vector register components for its
associated lane.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.png" /></p>
<p>The following expression defines the location of a source language variable that
has to occupy two vector registers. A composite location description is created
that combines the two parts. It will give the correct result regardless of which
lane corresponds to the source language thread of execution that the user is
focused on.</p>

<p>The DW_OP_regx VGPR0 pushes a location description for the first register.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 2" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_push_lane; DW_OP_uconst 4; DW_OP_mul calculates the offset for the
focused lanes vector register component as 4 times the lane number.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 3" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 4" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.4.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 5" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.5.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_offset adjusts the register location description’s offset to the
runtime computed value.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 6" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.6.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_piece either creates a new composite location description, or adds a
new part to an existing incomplete one. It pops the location description to use
for the new part. It then pops the next stack element if it is an incomplete
composite location description, otherwise it creates a new incomplete composite
location description with no parts. Finally it pushes the incomplete composite
after adding the new part.</p>
<p>In this case a register location description is added to a new incomplete
composite location description. The 4 of the DW_OP_piece specifies the size of
the register storage that comprises the part. Note that the 4 bytes start at the
computed register offset.</p>
<p>For backwards compatibility, if the stack is empty or the top stack element is
an incomplete composite, an undefined location description is used for the part.
If the top stack element is a generic base type value, then it is implicitly
converted to a global memory location description with an offset equal to the
value.</p>
<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 7" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.7.png" /></p>
<p>The rest of the expression does the same for VGPR1. However, when the
DW_OP_piece is evaluated there is an incomplete composite on the stack. So the
VGPR1 register location description is added as a second part.</p>

<p><img alt="Source Language Variable Spread Across Multiple Vector Registers Example: Step 13" src="../_images/07-extension-multi-lane-vgpr.example.frame.13.png" /></p>
<p>At the end of the expression, if the top stack element is an incomplete
composite location description, it is converted to a complete location
description and returned as the result.</p>

<p>The DW_OP_uconst 0xf00d; DW_OP_stack_value pushes an implicit location

the representation of the value 0xf00d using the generic base type’s encoding,

<p>The DW_OP_piece_end operation explicitly makes the incomplete composite location
description into a complete location description. This allows a complete
composite location description to be created on the stack that can be used as
the location description of another following operation. For example, the
DW_OP_offset can be applied to it. More practically, it permits creation of
multiple composite location descriptions on the stack which can be used to pass
arguments to a DWARF procedure using a DW_OP_call* operation. This can be
beneficial to factor the incrementally creation of location descriptions.</p>

<section id="address-spaces">
<h3>4.3.4 Address Spaces<a class="headerlink" href="#address-spaces" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Heterogeneous devices can have multiple hardware supported address spaces which
use specific hardware instructions to access them.</p>
<p>For example, GPUs that use SIMT execution may provide hardware support to access
memory such that each lane can see a linear memory view, while the backing
memory is actually being accessed in an interleaved manner so that the locations
for each lanes Nth dword are contiguous. This minimizes cache lines read by the
SIMT execution.</p>
<p><img alt="Address Spaces Example" src="../_images/09-extension-form-aspace.example.png" /></p>
<p>The following expression defines the location of a source language variable that
is allocated at offset 0x10 in the current subprograms stack frame. The
subprogram stack frames are per lane and reside in an interleaved address space.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>DW_OP_regval_type SGPR0 Generic

</pre></div>
</div>
<p><img alt="Address Spaces Example: Step 1" src="../_images/09-extension-form-aspace.example.frame.1.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_regval_type operation pushes the contents of SGPR0 as a generic value.
This is the register that holds the address of the current stack frame.</p>
<p><img alt="Address Spaces Example: Step 2" src="../_images/09-extension-form-aspace.example.frame.2.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_uconst operation pushes the address space number. Each architecture
defines the numbers it uses in DWARF. In this case, address space 1 is being
used as the per lane memory.</p>
<p><img alt="Address Spaces Example: Step 3" src="../_images/09-extension-form-aspace.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_form_aspace_address operation pops a value and an address space
number. Each address space is associated with a separate storage. A memory
location description is pushed which refers to the address space’s storage, with
an offset of the popped value.</p>
<p><img alt="Address Spaces Example: Step 4" src="../_images/09-extension-form-aspace.example.frame.4.png" /></p>
<p>All operations that act on location descriptions work with memory locations
regardless of their address space.</p>
<p>Every architecture defines address space 0 as the default global memory address
space.</p>
<p>Generalizing memory location descriptions to include an address space component
avoids having to create specialized operations to work with address spaces.</p>
<p>The source variable is at offset 0x10 in the stack frame. The DW_OP_offset
operation works on memory location descriptions that have an address space just
like for any other kind of location description.</p>
<p><img alt="Address Spaces Example: Step 5" src="../_images/09-extension-form-aspace.example.frame.5.png" /></p>
<p>The only operations in DWARF 5 that take an address space are DW_OP_xderef*.
They treat a value as the address in a specified address space, and read its
contents. There is no operation to actually create a location description that
references an address space. There is no way to include address space memory
locations in parts of composite locations.</p>
<p>Since DW_OP_piece now takes any kind of location description for its pieces, it
is now possible for parts of a composite to involve locations in different
address spaces. For example, this can happen when parts of a source variable
allocated in a register are spilled to a stack frame that resides in the
non-global address space.</p>

<section id="bit-offsets">
<h3>4.3.5 Bit Offsets<a class="headerlink" href="#bit-offsets" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the generalization of location descriptions on the stack, it is possible to
define a DW_OP_bit_offset operation that adjusts the offset of any kind of
location in terms of bits rather than bytes. The offset can be a runtime
computed value. This is generally useful for any source language that support
bit sized entities, and for registers that are not a whole number of bytes.</p>
<p>DWARF 5 only supports bit fields in composites using DW_OP_bit_piece. It does
not support runtime computed offsets which can happen for bit field packed
arrays. It is also not generally composable as it must be the last part of an
expression.</p>
<p>The following example defines a location description for a source variable that
is allocated starting at bit 20 of a register. A similar expression could be
used if the source variable was at a bit offset within memory or a particular
address space, or if the offset is a runtime value.</p>

<p><img alt="Bit Offsets Example: Step 3" src="../_images/10-extension-bit-offset.example.frame.3.png" /></p>
<p>The DW_OP_bit_offset operation pops a value and location description from the
stack. It pushes the location description after updating its offset using the
value as a bit count.</p>
<p><img alt="Bit Offsets Example: Step 4" src="../_images/10-extension-bit-offset.example.frame.4.png" /></p>
<p>The ordering of bits within a byte, like byte ordering, is defined by the target
architecture. A base type could be extended to specify bit ordering in addition
to byte ordering.</p>

<section id="call-frame-information-cfi">
<h2>4.4 Call Frame Information (CFI)<a class="headerlink" href="#call-frame-information-cfi" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>DWARF defines call frame information (CFI) that can be used to virtually unwind
the subprogram call stack. This involves determining the location where register
values have been spilled. DWARF 5 limits these locations to either be registers
or global memory. As shown in the earlier examples, heterogeneous devices may
spill registers to parts of other registers, to non-global memory address
spaces, or even a composite of different location kinds.</p>
<p>Therefore, the extension extends the CFI rules to support any kind of location
description, and operations to create locations in address spaces.</p>
</section>
<section id="objects-not-in-byte-aligned-global-memory">
<h2>4.5 Objects Not In Byte Aligned Global Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#objects-not-in-byte-aligned-global-memory" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>DWARF 5 only effectively supports byte aligned memory locations on the stack by
using a global memory address as a proxy for a memory location description. This
is a problem for attributes that define DWARF expressions that require the
location of some source language entity that is not allocated in byte aligned
global memory.</p>
<p>For example, the DWARF expression of the DW_AT_data_member_location attribute is
evaluated with an initial stack containing the location of a type instance
object. That object could be located in a register, in a non-global memory
address space, be described by a composite location description, or could even
be an implicit location description.</p>
<p>A similar problem exists for DWARF expressions that use the
DW_OP_push_object_address operation. This operation pushes the location of a
program object associated with the attribute that defines the expression.</p>
<p>Allowing any kind of location description on the stack permits the DW_OP_call*
operations to be used to factor the creation of location descriptions. The
inputs and outputs of the call are passed on the stack. For example, on GPUs an
expression can be defined to describe the effective PC of inactive lanes of SIMT
execution. This is naturally done by composing the result of expressions for
each nested control flow region. This can be done by making each control flow
region have its own DWARF procedure, and then calling it from the expressions of
the nested control flow regions. The alternative is to make each control flow
region have the complete expression which results in much larger DWARF and is
less convenient to generate.</p>
<p>GPU compilers work hard to allocate objects in the larger number of registers to
reduce memory accesses, they have to use different memory address spaces, and
they perform optimizations that result in composites of these. Allowing
operations to work with any kind of location description enables creating
expressions that support all of these.</p>
<p>Full general support for bit fields and implicit locations benefits
optimizations on any target.</p>
</section>
<section id="higher-order-operations">
<h2>4.6 Higher Order Operations<a class="headerlink" href="#higher-order-operations" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The generalization allows an elegant way to add higher order operations that
create location descriptions out of other location descriptions in a general
composable manner.</p>
<p>For example, a DW_OP_extend operation could create a composite location
description out of a location description, an element size, and an element
count. The resulting composite would effectively be a vector of element count
elements with each element being the same location description of the specified
bit size.</p>
<p>A DW_OP_select_bit_piece operation could create a composite location description
out of two location descriptions, a bit mask value, and an element size. The
resulting composite would effectively be a vector of elements, selecting from
one of the two input locations according to the bit mask.</p>
<p>These could be used in the expression of an attribute that computes the
effective PC of lanes of SIMT execution. The vector result efficiently computes
the PC for each SIMT lane at once. The mask could be the hardware execution mask
register that controls which SIMT lanes are executing. For active divergent
lanes the vector element would be the current PC, and for inactive divergent
lanes the PC would correspond to the source language line at which the lane is
logically positioned.</p>
<p>Similarly, a DW_OP_overlay_piece operation could be defined that creates a
composite location description out of two location descriptions, an offset
value, and a size. The resulting composite would consist of parts that are
equivalent to one of the location descriptions, but with the other location
description replacing a slice defined by the offset and size. This could be used
to efficiently express a source language array that has had a set of elements
promoted into a vector register when executing a set of iterations of a loop in
a SIMD manner.</p>
</section>
<section id="objects-in-multiple-places">
<h2>4.7 Objects In Multiple Places<a class="headerlink" href="#objects-in-multiple-places" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A compiler may allocate a source variable in stack frame memory, but for some
range of code may promote it to a register. If the generated code does not
change the register value, then there is no need to save it back to memory.
Effectively, during that range, the source variable is in both memory and a
register. If a consumer, such as a debugger, allows the user to change the value
of the source variable in that PC range, then it would need to change both
places.</p>
<p>DWARF 5 supports loclists which are able to specify the location of a source
language entity is in different places at different PC locations. It can also
express that a source language entity is in multiple places at the same time.</p>
<p>DWARF 5 defines operation expressions and loclists separately. In general, this
is adequate as non-memory location descriptions can only be computed as the last
step of an expression evaluation.</p>
<p>However, allowing location descriptions on the stack permits non-memory location
descriptions to be used in the middle of expression evaluation. For example, the
DW_OP_call* and DW_OP_implicit_pointer operations can result in evaluating the
expression of a DW_AT_location attribute of a DIE. The DW_AT_location attribute
allows the loclist form. So the result could include multiple location
descriptions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the DWARF expression associated with attributes such as
DW_AT_data_member_location that are evaluated with an initial stack containing a
location description, or a DWARF operation expression that uses the
DW_OP_push_object_address operation, may want to act on the result of another
expression that returned a location description involving multiple places.</p>
<p>Therefore, the extension needs to define how expression operations that use those
results will behave. The extension does this by generalizing the expression stack
to allow an entry to be one or more single location descriptions. In doing this,
it unifies the definitions of DWARF operation expressions and loclist
expressions in a natural way.</p>
<p>All operations that act on location descriptions are extended to act on multiple
single location descriptions. For example, the DW_OP_offset operation adds the
offset to each single location description. The DW_OP_deref* operations simply
read the storage of one of the single location descriptions, since multiple
single location descriptions must all hold the same value. Similarly, if the
evaluation of a DWARF expression results in multiple single location
descriptions, the consumer can ensure any updates are done to all of them, and
any reads can use any one of them.</p>

<h1>5. Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>A strength of DWARF is that it has generally sought to provide generalized
composable solutions that address many problems, rather than solutions that only
address one-off issues. This extension attempts to follow that tradition by
defining a backwards compatible composable generalization that can address a
significant family of issues. It addresses the specific issues present for
heterogeneous computing devices, provides benefits for non-heterogeneous
devices, and can help address a number of other previously reported issues.</p>

<p>DWARF expressions describe how to compute a value or specify a location.</p>
<p><i>The evaluation of a DWARF expression can provide the location of an object,
the value of an array bound, the length of a dynamic string, the desired value
itself, and so on.</i></p>
<p>If the evaluation of a DWARF expression does not encounter an error, then it can
either result in a value (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-2-dwarf-expression-value">2.5.2 DWARF Expression
Value</a>) or a location description (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-3-dwarf-location-description">2.5.3 DWARF
Location Description</a>). When a DWARF expression
is evaluated, it may be specified whether a value or location description is
required as the result kind.</p>
<p>If a result kind is specified, and the result of the evaluation does not match
the specified result kind, then the implicit conversions described in
<a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-4-3-memory-location-description-operations">2.5.4.4.3 Memory Location Description Operations</a>

<p>If the evaluation of a DWARF expression encounters an evaluation error, then the
result is an evaluation error.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: Decided to define the concept of an evaluation error. An alternative is
to introduce an undefined value base type in a similar way to location
descriptions having an undefined location description. Then operations that

<p>All operations that act on values would return an undefined entity if given an

context elements. If multiple context elements are specified then they must be
self consistent or the result of the evaluation is undefined. The context
elements that can be specified are:</p>

<li><p><i>A current result kind</i></p>
<p>The kind of result required by the DWARF expression evaluation. If specified
it can be a location description or a value.</p>
</li>

<p>The target architecture thread identifier of the source program thread of
execution for which a user presented expression is currently being
evaluated.</p>
<p>It is required for operations that are related to target architecture
threads.</p>
<p><i>For example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_regval_type</span></code> operation.</i></p>
</li>
<li><p><i>A current call frame</i></p>
<p>The target architecture call frame identifier. It identifies a call frame
that corresponds to an active invocation of a subprogram in the current
thread. It is identified by its address on the call stack. The address is
referred to as the Canonical Frame Address (CFA). The call frame information
is used to determine the CFA for the call frames of the current thread’s
call stack (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-6-4-call-frame-information">6.4 Call Frame Information</a>).</p>

with the same compilation unit, including indicating if such references use
the 32-bit or 64-bit DWARF format. It can also provide the default address
space address size if no current target architecture is specified.</p>
<p><i>For example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_constx</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_addrx</span></code> operations.</i></p>

<p>The target architecture.</p>

identifiers, DWARF address space identifiers, the default address space, and
the address space address sizes.</i></p>

<p>The location description of a program object.</p>
<p>It is required for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_push_object_address</span></code> operation.</p>
<p><i>For example, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_data_location</span></code> attribute on type debug

<h4>A.2.5.3 DWARF Location Description<a class="headerlink" href="#a-2-5-3-dwarf-location-description" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p><i>Debugging information must provide consumers a way to find the location of
program variables, determine the bounds of dynamic arrays and strings, and
possibly to find the base address of a subprogram’s call frame or the return
address of a subprogram. Furthermore, to meet the needs of recent computer
architectures and optimization techniques, debugging information must be able to
describe the location of an object whose location changes over the object’s
lifetime, and may reside at multiple locations simultaneously during parts of an
object’s lifetime.</i></p>
<p>Information about the location of program objects is provided by location
descriptions.</p>
<p>Location descriptions can consist of one or more single location descriptions.</p>
<p>A single location description specifies the location storage that holds a
program object and a position within the location storage where the program
object starts. The position within the location storage is expressed as a bit
offset relative to the start of the location storage.</p>
<p>A location storage is a linear stream of bits that can hold values. Each
location storage has a size in bits and can be accessed using a zero-based bit
offset. The ordering of bits within a location storage uses the bit numbering
and direction conventions that are appropriate to the current language on the
target architecture.</p>
<p>There are five kinds of location storage:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><i>memory location storage</i></p>
<p>Corresponds to the target architecture memory address spaces.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>register location storage</i></p>
<p>Corresponds to the target architecture registers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>implicit location storage</i></p>
<p>Corresponds to fixed values that can only be read.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>undefined location storage</i></p>
<p>Indicates no value is available and therefore cannot be read or written.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>composite location storage</i></p>
<p>Allows a mixture of these where some bits come from one location storage and
some from another location storage, or from disjoint parts of the same
location storage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: It may be better to add an implicit pointer location storage kind used
by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_implicit_pointer</span></code> operation. It would specify the debugger

static or the same as the lexical block (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-3-5-lexical-block-entries">3.5 Lexical Block
Entries</a>) that owns it, and it does not move during
its lifetime.</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>They can be the result of evaluating a debugger information entry attribute
that specifies a location list expression. In this usage they can describe the
location of an object that has a limited lifetime, changes its location during
its lifetime, or has multiple locations over part or all of its lifetime.</i></p></li>
</ul>
<p>If a location description has more than one single location description, the
DWARF expression is ill-formed if the object value held in each single location
description’s position within the associated location storage is not the same
value, except for the parts of the value that are uninitialized.</p>
<p><i>A location description that has more than one single location description can
only be created by a location list expression that has overlapping program
location ranges, or certain expression operations that act on a location
description that has more than one single location description. There are no
operation expression operations that can directly create a location description
with more than one single location description.</i></p>
<p><i>A location description with more than one single location description can be
used to describe objects that reside in more than one piece of storage at the
same time. An object may have more than one location as a result of
optimization. For example, a value that is only read may be promoted from memory
to a register for some region of code, but later code may revert to reading the
value from memory as the register may be used for other purposes. For the code
region where the value is in a register, any change to the object value must be
made in both the register and the memory so both regions of code will read the
updated value.</i></p>
<p><i>A consumer of a location description with more than one single location
description can read the object’s value from any of the single location
descriptions (since they all refer to location storage that has the same value),
but must write any changed value to all the single location descriptions.</i></p>
<p>Updating a location description L by a bit offset B is defined as adding the
value of B to the bit offset of each single location description SL of L. It is
an evaluation error if the updated bit offset of any SL is less than 0 or
greater than or equal to the size of the location storage specified by SL.</p>
<p>The evaluation of an expression may require context elements to create a
location description. If such a location description is accessed, the storage it
denotes is that associated with the context element values specified when the
location description was created, which may differ from the context at the time
it is accessed.</p>
<p><i>For example, creating a register location description requires the thread
context: the location storage is for the specified register of that thread.
Creating a memory location description for an address space may required a
thread context: the location storage is the memory associated with that
thread.</i></p>
<p>If any of the context elements required to create a location description change,
the location description becomes invalid and accessing it is undefined.</p>
<p><i>Examples of context that can invalidate a location description are:</i></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><i>The thread context is required and execution causes the thread to
terminate.</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>The call frame context is required and further execution causes the call
frame to return to the calling frame.</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>The program location is required and further execution of the thread
occurs. That could change the location list entry or call frame information
entry that applies.</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>An operation uses call frame information:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>Any of the frames used in the virtual call frame unwinding return.</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>The top call frame is used, the program location is used to select the
call frame information entry, and further execution of the thread
occurs.</i></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>A DWARF expression can be used to compute a location description for an
object. A subsequent DWARF expression evaluation can be given the object
location description as the object context or initial stack context to compute a
component of the object. The final result is undefined if the object location
description becomes invalid between the two expression evaluations.</i></p>
<p>A change of a thread’s program location may not make a location description
invalid, yet may still render it as no longer meaningful. Accessing such a
location description, or using it as the object context or initial stack context
of an expression evaluation, may produce an undefined result.</p>
<p><i>For example, a location description may specify a register that no longer
holds the intended program object after a program location change. One way to
avoid such problems is to recompute location descriptions associated with
threads when their program locations change.</i></p>

<h4>A.2.5.4 DWARF Operation Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>An operation expression is comprised of a stream of operations, each consisting
of an opcode followed by zero or more operands. The number of operands is
implied by the opcode.</p>
<p>Operations represent a postfix operation on a simple stack machine. Each stack
entry can hold either a value or a location description. Operations can act on
entries on the stack, including adding entries and removing entries. If the kind
of a stack entry does not match the kind required by the operation and is not
implicitly convertible to the required kind
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-4-3-memory-location-description-operations">2.5.4.4.3 Memory Location Description Operations</a>),
then the DWARF operation expression is ill-formed.</p>
<p>Evaluation of an operation expression starts with an empty stack on which the
entries from the initial stack provided by the context are pushed in the order
provided. Then the operations are evaluated, starting with the first operation
of the stream. Evaluation continues until either an operation has an evaluation
error, or until one past the last operation of the stream is reached.</p>
<p>The result of the evaluation is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If an operation has an evaluation error, or an operation evaluates an
expression that has an evaluation error, then the result is an evaluation
error.</p></li>

<div><p>NOTE: DWARF Version 5 states that DR can be an offset in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.debug_info</span></code>
section other than the one that contains the current compilation unit. It
states that relocation of references from one executable or shared object
file to another must be performed by the consumer. But given that DR is
defined as an offset in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.debug_info</span></code> section this seems impossible. If
DR was defined as an implementation defined value, then the consumer could
choose to interpret the value in an implementation defined manner to
reference a debug information in another executable or shared object.</p>
<p>In ELF the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.debug_info</span></code> section is in a non-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PT_LOAD</span></code> segment so standard
dynamic relocations cannot be used. But even if they were loaded segments
and dynamic relocations were used, DR would need to be the address of D,
not an offset in a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.debug_info</span></code> section. That would also need DR to be
the size of a global address. So it would not be possible to use the
32-bit DWARF format in a 64-bit global address space. In addition, the
consumer would need to determine what executable or shared object the
relocated address was in so it could determine the containing compilation
unit.</p>

specifies an operation expression E, then execution of the current
operation expression continues from the first operation of E. Execution
continues until one past the last operation of E is reached, at which
point execution continues with the operation following the call operation.
The operations of E are evaluated with the same current context, except
current compilation unit is the one that contains D and the stack is the
same as that being used by the call operation. After the call operation
has been evaluated, the stack is therefore as it is left by the evaluation
of the operations of E. Since E is evaluated on the same stack as the call
operation, E can use, and/or remove entries already on the stack, and can
add new entries to the stack.</p>
<p><i>Values on the stack at the time of the call may be used as parameters
by the called expression and values left on the stack by the called

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptr</span></code>, then the specified location list expression E is evaluated.
The evaluation of E uses the current context, except the result kind is a
location description, the compilation unit is the one that contains D, and
the initial stack is empty. The location description result is pushed on
the stack.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: This rule avoids having to define how to execute a matched
location list entry operation expression on the same stack as the call
when there are multiple matches. But it allows the call to obtain the
location description for a variable or formal parameter which may use a
location list expression.</p>
<p>An alternative is to treat the case when D has a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_location</span></code>
attribute that is encoded as a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclist</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptr</span></code>, and the
specified location list expression E’ matches a single location list
entry with operation expression E, the same as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exprloc</span></code> case and
evaluate on the same stack.</p>
<p>But this is not attractive as if the attribute is for a variable that
happens to end with a non-singleton stack, it will not simply put a
location description on the stack. Presumably the intent of using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> on a variable or formal parameter debugger information
entry is to push just one location description on the stack. That
location description may have more than one single location description.</p>
<p>The previous rule for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exprloc</span></code> also has the same problem, as normally a
variable or formal parameter location expression may leave multiple
entries on the stack and only return the top entry.</p>
<p>GDB implements <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> by always executing E on the same stack. If
the location list has multiple matching entries, it simply picks the
first one and ignores the rest. This seems fundamentally at odds with
the desire to support multiple places for variables.</p>
<p>So, it feels like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> should both support pushing a location
description on the stack for a variable or formal parameter, and also
support being able to execute an operation expression on the same stack.
Being able to specify a different operation expression for different
program locations seems a desirable feature to retain.</p>
<p>A solution to that is to have a distinct <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_proc</span></code> attribute for the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure</span></code> debugging information entry. Then the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_location</span></code> attribute expression is always executed separately and
pushes a location description (that may have multiple single location
descriptions), and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_proc</span></code> attribute expression is always
executed on the same stack and can leave anything on the stack.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_proc</span></code> attribute could have the new classes <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exprproc</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistproc</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptrproc</span></code> to indicate that the expression is
executed on the same stack. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exprproc</span></code> is the same encoding as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exprloc</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistproc</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptrproc</span></code> are the same encoding as
their non-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proc</span></code> counterparts, except the DWARF is ill-formed if the
location list does not match exactly one location list entry and a
default entry is required. These forms indicate explicitly that the
matched single operation expression must be executed on the same stack.
This is better than ad hoc special rules for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistproc</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptrproc</span></code> which are currently clearly defined to always return a
location description. The producer then explicitly indicates the intent
through the attribute classes.</p>
<p>Such a change would be a breaking change for how GDB implements
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code>. However, are the breaking cases actually occurring in
practice? GDB could implement the current approach for DWARF Version 5,
and the new semantics for DWARF Version 6 which has been done for some
other features.</p>
<p>Another option is to limit the execution to be on the same stack only to
the evaluation of an expression E that is the value of a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_location</span></code> attribute of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure</span></code> debugging
information entry. The DWARF would be ill-formed if E is a location list
expression that does not match exactly one location list entry. In all
other cases the evaluation of an expression E that is the value of a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_location</span></code> attribute would evaluate E with the current context,
except the result kind is a location description, the compilation unit
is the one that contains D, and the initial stack is empty. The location
description result is pushed on the stack.</p>

a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_implicit_value</span> <span class="pre">V</span></code> operation was executed.</p>
<p><i>This allows a call operation to be used to compute the location

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> to get a location description for any
non-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_TAG_dwarf_procedure</span></code> debugging information entries. Also, the

<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: Should DWARF allow the type T to be a larger size than the size of
the register R? Restricting a larger bit size avoids any issue of
conversion as the, possibly truncated, bit contents of the register is
simply interpreted as a value of T. If a conversion is wanted it can be
done explicitly using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_convert</span></code> operation.</p>
<p>GDB has a per register hook that allows a target specific conversion on a
register by register basis. It defaults to truncation of bigger registers.
Removing use of the target hook does not cause any test failures in common
architectures. If the compiler for a target architecture did want some
form of conversion, including a larger result type, it could always
explicitly use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_convert</span></code> operation.</p>
<p>If T is a larger type than the register size, then the default GDB
register hook reads bytes from the next register (or reads out of bounds
for the last register!). Removing use of the target hook does not cause
any test failures in common architectures (except an illegal hand written
assembly test). If a target architecture requires this behavior, these
extensions allow a composite location description to be used to combine
multiple registers.</p>

<div><p>NOTE: This operation could be removed and the object location description
specified as the initial stack as for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_data_member_location</span></code>.</p>
<p>Or this operation could be used instead of needing to specify an initial
stack. The latter approach is more composable as access to the object may
be needed at any point of the expression, and passing it as the initial
stack requires the entire expression to be aware where on the stack it is.
If this were done, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_use_location</span></code> would require a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_push_object2_address</span></code> operation for the second object.</p>
<p>Or a more general way to pass an arbitrary number of arguments in and an
operation to get the Nth one such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_arg</span> <span class="pre">N</span></code>. A vector of
arguments would then be passed in the expression context rather than an
initial stack. This could also resolve the issues with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> by
allowing a specific number of arguments passed in and returned to be
specified. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> operation could then always execute on a

<p>Each of the target architecture specific address spaces has a corresponding
memory location storage that denotes the linear addressable memory of that
address space. The size of each memory location storage corresponds to the range
of the addresses in the corresponding address space.</p>
<p><i>It is target architecture defined how address space location storage maps to
target architecture physical memory. For example, they may be independent
memory, or more than one location storage may alias the same physical memory
possibly at different offsets and with different interleaving. The mapping may
also be dictated by the source language address classes.</i></p>
<p>A memory location description specifies a memory location storage. The bit
offset corresponds to a bit position within a byte of the memory. Bits accessed
using a memory location description, access the corresponding target
architecture memory starting at the bit position within the byte specified by
the bit offset.</p>
<p>A memory location description that has a bit offset that is a multiple of 8 (the
byte size) is defined to be a byte address memory location description. It has a
memory byte address A that is equal to the bit offset divided by 8.</p>
<p>A memory location description that does not have a bit offset that is a multiple
of 8 (the byte size) is defined to be a bit field memory location description.
It has a bit position B equal to the bit offset modulo 8, and a memory byte
address A equal to the bit offset minus B that is then divided by 8.</p>
<p>The address space AS of a memory location description is defined to be the
address space that corresponds to the memory location storage associated with
the memory location description.</p>
<p>A location description that is comprised of one byte address memory location
description SL is defined to be a memory byte address location description. It
has a byte address equal to A and an address space equal to AS of the
corresponding SL.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_ASPACE_none</span></code> is defined as the target architecture default address space.</p>
<p>If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but it is a value V
with the generic type, then it is implicitly converted to a location description
L with one memory location description SL. SL specifies the memory location
storage that corresponds to the target architecture default address space with a
bit offset equal to V scaled by 8 (the byte size).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: If it is wanted to allow any integral type value to be implicitly
converted to a memory location description in the target architecture default
address space:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but is a value V
with an integral type, then it is implicitly converted to a location
description L with a one memory location description SL. If the type size of
V is less than the generic type size, then the value V is zero extended to
the size of the generic type. The least significant generic type size bits
are treated as an unsigned value to be used as an address A. SL specifies
memory location storage corresponding to the target architecture default
address space with a bit offset equal to A scaled by 8 (the byte size).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The implicit conversion could also be defined as target architecture specific.
For example, GDB checks if V is an integral type. If it is not it gives an
error. Otherwise, GDB zero-extends V to 64 bits. If the GDB target defines a
hook function, then it is called. The target specific hook function can modify
the 64-bit value, possibly sign extending based on the original value type.
Finally, GDB treats the 64-bit value V as a memory location address.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If a stack entry is required to be a location description, but it is an implicit
pointer value IPV with the target architecture default address space, then it is
implicitly converted to a location description with one single location
description specified by IPV. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-4-5-implicit-location-description-operations">2.5.4.4.5 Implicit Location Description Operations</a>.</p>
<p>If a stack entry is required to be a value, but it is a location description L
with one memory location description SL in the target architecture default
address space with a bit offset B that is a multiple of 8, then it is implicitly
converted to a value equal to B divided by 8 (the byte size) with the generic
type.</p>

description that corresponds to the thread-local storage address TA.</p>
<p>The meaning of the thread-local storage address TA is defined by the
run-time environment. If the run-time environment supports multiple
thread-local storage blocks for a single thread, then the block
corresponding to the executable or shared library containing this DWARF

<p><i>Some implementations of C, C++, Fortran, and other languages, support a
thread-local storage class. Variables with this storage class have distinct
values and addresses in distinct threads, much as automatic variables have
distinct values and addresses in each subprogram invocation. Typically,
there is a single block of storage containing all thread-local variables
declared in the main executable, and a separate block for the variables
declared in each shared library. Each thread-local variable can then be
accessed in its block using an identifier. This identifier is typically a
byte offset into the block and pushed onto the DWARF stack by one of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_const*</span></code> operations prior to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_form_tls_address</span></code> operation.

complex thread-local storage calculations into the DWARF expressions, the

<div><p>NOTE: This section replaces DWARF Version 5 section 2.6.1.2.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A composite location storage represents an object or value which may be
contained in part of another location storage or contained in parts of more than
one location storage.</p>
<p>Each part has a part location description L and a part bit size S. L can have
one or more single location descriptions SL. If there are more than one SL then
that indicates that part is located in more than one place. The bits of each
place of the part comprise S contiguous bits from the location storage LS
specified by SL starting at the bit offset specified by SL. All the bits must be
within the size of LS or the DWARF expression is ill-formed.</p>
<p>A composite location storage can have zero or more parts. The parts are
contiguous such that the zero-based location storage bit index will range over
each part with no gaps between them. Therefore, the size of a composite location
storage is the sum of the size of its parts. The DWARF expression is ill-formed
if the size of the contiguous location storage is larger than the size of the
memory location storage corresponding to the largest target architecture
specific address space.</p>
<p>A composite location description specifies a composite location storage. The bit
offset corresponds to a bit position within the composite location storage.</p>
<p>There are operations that create a composite location storage.</p>
<p>There are other operations that allow a composite location storage to be
incrementally created. Each part is created by a separate operation. There may
be one or more operations to create the final composite location storage. A
series of such operations describes the parts of the composite location storage
that are in the order that the associated part operations are executed.</p>
<p>To support incremental creation, a composite location storage can be in an
incomplete state. When an incremental operation operates on an incomplete
composite location storage, it adds a new part.</p>
<p>A composite location description that specifies a composite location storage
that is incomplete is termed an incomplete composite location description. A
composite location description that specifies a composite location storage that
is complete is termed a complete composite location description.</p>
<p>If the top stack entry is a location description that has one incomplete
composite location description SL after the execution of an operation expression

<h4>A.2.5.5 DWARF Location List Expressions<a class="headerlink" href="#a-2-5-5-dwarf-location-list-expressions" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: This section replaces DWARF Version 5 section 2.6.2.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><i>To meet the needs of recent computer architectures and optimization
techniques, debugging information must be able to describe the location of an
object whose location changes over the object’s lifetime, and may reside at
multiple locations during parts of an object’s lifetime. Location list
expressions are used in place of operation expressions whenever the object whose
location is being described has these requirements.</i></p>
<p>A location list expression consists of a series of location list entries. Each
location list entry is one of the following kinds:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><i>Bounded location description</i></p>
<p>This kind of location list entry provides an operation expression that
evaluates to the location description of an object that is valid over a
lifetime bounded by a starting and ending address. The starting address is
the lowest address of the address range over which the location is valid.
The ending address is the address of the first location past the highest
address of the address range.</p>
<p>The location list entry matches when the current program location is within
the given range.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of bounded location description entries which differ
in the way that they specify the starting and ending addresses.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>Default location description</i></p>
<p>This kind of location list entry provides an operation expression that
evaluates to the location description of an object that is valid when no
bounded location description entry applies.</p>
<p>The location list entry matches when the current program location is not
within the range of any bounded location description entry.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>Base address</i></p>
<p>This kind of location list entry provides an address to be used as the base
address for beginning and ending address offsets given in certain kinds of
bounded location description entries. The applicable base address of a
bounded location description entry is the address specified by the closest
preceding base address entry in the same location list. If there is no
preceding base address entry, then the applicable base address defaults to
the base address of the compilation unit (see DWARF Version 5 section
3.1.1).</p>
<p>In the case of a compilation unit where all of the machine code is contained
in a single contiguous section, no base address entry is needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>End-of-list</i></p>
<p>This kind of location list entry marks the end of the location list
expression.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The address ranges defined by the bounded location description entries of a
location list expression may overlap. When they do, they describe a situation in
which an object exists simultaneously in more than one place.</p>
<p>If all of the address ranges in a given location list expression do not
collectively cover the entire range over which the object in question is
defined, and there is no following default location description entry, it is
assumed that the object is not available for the portion of the range that is
not covered.</p>
<p>The result of the evaluation of a DWARF location list expression is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the current program location is not specified, then it is an evaluation
error.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: If the location list only has a single default entry, should that be
considered a match if there is no program location? If there are non-default
entries then it seems it has to be an evaluation error when there is no
program location as that indicates the location depends on the program
location which is not known.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>If there are no matching location list entries, then the result is a location
description that comprises one undefined location description.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, the operation expression E of each matching location list entry is
evaluated with the current context, except that the result kind is a location
description, the object is unspecified, and the initial stack is empty. The
location list entry result is the location description returned by the
evaluation of E.</p>
<p>The result is a location description that is comprised of the union of the
single location descriptions of the location description result of each
matching location list entry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A location list expression can only be used as the value of a debugger
information entry attribute that is encoded using class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclist</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptr</span></code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-7-5-5-classes-and-forms">7.5.5 Classes and Forms</a>). The value of
the attribute provides an index into a separate object file section called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.debug_loclists</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.debug_loclists.dwo</span></code> (for split DWARF object files) that
contains the location list entries.</p>
<p>A <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_call*</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_implicit_pointer</span></code> operation can be used to specify a
debugger information entry attribute that has a location list expression.
Several debugger information entry attributes allow DWARF expressions that are
evaluated with an initial stack that includes a location description that may
originate from the evaluation of a location list expression.</p>
<p><i>This location list representation, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclist</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loclistsptr</span></code> class, and
the related <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_loclists_base</span></code> attribute are new in DWARF Version 5. Together
they eliminate most, or all of the code object relocations previously needed for
location list expressions.</i></p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_TAG_ptr_to_member_type</span></code> debugging information entry has a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_use_location</span></code> attribute whose value is a DWARF expression E. It is used
to compute the location description of the member of the class to which the
pointer to member entry points.</p>
<p><i>The method used to find the location description of a given member of a
class, structure, or union is common to any instance of that class, structure,
or union and to any instance of the pointer to member type. The method is thus
associated with the pointer to member type, rather than with each object that
has a pointer to member type.</i></p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_use_location</span></code> DWARF expression is used in conjunction with the
location description for a particular object of the given pointer to member type
and for a particular structure or class instance.</p>
<p>The result of the attribute is obtained by evaluating E with a context that has
a result kind of a location description, an unspecified object, the compilation
unit that contains E, an initial stack comprising two entries, and other context
elements corresponding to the source language thread of execution upon which the
user is focused, if any. The first stack entry is the value of the pointer to
member object itself. The second stack entry is the location description of the
base of the entire class, structure, or union instance containing the member
whose location is being calculated. The result of the evaluation is the location
description of the member of the class to which the pointer to member entry
points.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_data_location</span></code> attribute may be used with any type that provides one
or more levels of hidden indirection and/or run-time parameters in its
representation. Its value is a DWARF operation expression E which computes the
location description of the data for an object. When this attribute is omitted,
the location description of the data is the same as the location description of
the object.</p>
<p>The result of the attribute is obtained by evaluating E with a context that has
a result kind of a location description, an object that is the location
description of the data descriptor, the compilation unit that contains E, an
empty initial stack, and other context elements corresponding to the source
language thread of execution upon which the user is focused, if any. The result
of the evaluation is the location description of the base of the member entry.</p>
<p><i>E will typically involve an operation expression that begins with a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_OP_push_object_address</span></code> operation which loads the location description
of the object which can then serve as a descriptor in subsequent
calculation.</i></p>

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_vtable_elem_location</span></code> allow both operation expressions and location
list expressions, why does <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_AT_data_location</span></code> not allow both? In all cases
they apply to data objects so less likely that optimization would cause
different operation expressions for different program location ranges. But if
supporting for some then should be for all.</p>

<h4>A.6.4.1 Structure of Call Frame Information<a class="headerlink" href="#a-6-4-1-structure-of-call-frame-information" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>The register rules are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><i>undefined</i></p>
<p>A register that has this rule has no recoverable value in the previous
frame. The previous value of this register is the undefined location
description (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-4-2-undefined-location-description-operations">2.5.4.4.2 Undefined Location Description
Operations</a>).</p>
<p><i>By convention, the register is not preserved by a callee.</i></p>
</li>
<li><p><i>same value</i></p>
<p>This register has not been modified from the previous caller frame.</p>
<p>If the current frame is the top frame, then the previous value of this
register is the location description L that specifies one register location
description SL. SL specifies the register location storage that corresponds
to the register with a bit offset of 0 for the current thread.</p>
<p>If the current frame is not the top frame, then the previous value of this
register is the location description obtained using the call frame
information for the callee frame and callee program location invoked by the
current caller frame for the same register.</p>
<p><i>By convention, the register is preserved by the callee, but the callee
has not modified it.</i></p>
</li>
<li><p><i>offset(N)</i></p>
<p>N is a signed byte offset. The previous value of this register is saved at
the location description L. Where L is the location description of the
current CFA (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions">2.5.4 DWARF Operation
Expressions</a>) updated with the bit offset N
scaled by 8 (the byte size).</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>val_offset(N)</i></p>
<p>N is a signed byte offset. The previous value of this register is the memory
byte address of the location description L. Where L is the location
description of the current CFA (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions">2.5.4 DWARF Operation
Expressions</a>) updated with the bit offset N
scaled by 8 (the byte size).</p>
<p>The DWARF is ill-formed if the CFA location description is not a memory byte
address location description, or if the register size does not match the
size of an address in the target architecture default address space.</p>
<p><i>Since the CFA location description is required to be a memory byte
address location description, the value of val_offset(N) will also be a
memory byte address location description since it is offsetting the CFA
location description by N bytes. Furthermore, the value of val_offset(N)
will be a memory byte address in the target architecture default address
space.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: Should DWARF allow the address size to be a different size to the
size of the register? Requiring them to be the same bit size avoids any
issue of conversion as the bit contents of the register is simply
interpreted as a value of the address.</p>
<p>GDB has a per register hook that allows a target specific conversion on a
register by register basis. It defaults to truncation of bigger registers,
and to actually reading bytes from the next register (or reads out of
bounds for the last register) for smaller registers. There are no GDB
tests that read a register out of bounds (except an illegal hand written
assembly test).</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><i>register(R)</i></p>
<p>This register has been stored in another register numbered R.</p>
<p>The previous value of this register is the location description obtained
using the call frame information for the current frame and current program
location for register R.</p>
<p>The DWARF is ill-formed if the size of this register does not match the size
of register R or if there is a cyclic dependency in the call frame
information.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: Should this also allow R to be larger than this register? If so is
the value stored in the low order bits and it is undefined what is stored
in the extra upper bits?</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><i>expression(E)</i></p>
<p>The previous value of this register is located at the location description
produced by evaluating the DWARF operation expression E (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions">2.5.4 DWARF
Operation Expressions</a>).</p>
<p>E is evaluated with the current context, except the result kind is a
location description, the compilation unit is unspecified, the object is
unspecified, and an initial stack comprising the location description of the
current CFA (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions">2.5.4 DWARF Operation
Expressions</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><i>val_expression(E)</i></p>
<p>The previous value of this register is located at the implicit location
description created from the value produced by evaluating the DWARF
operation expression E (see <a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions">2.5.4 DWARF Operation
Expressions</a>).</p>
<p>E is evaluated with the current context, except the result kind is a value,
the compilation unit is unspecified, the object is unspecified, and an
initial stack comprising the location description of the current CFA (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#a-2-5-4-dwarf-operation-expressions">2.5.4 DWARF Operation Expressions</a>).</p>
<p>The DWARF is ill-formed if the resulting value type size does not match the
register size.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>NOTE: This has limited usefulness as the DWARF expression E can only
produce values up to the size of the generic type. This is due to not
allowing any operations that specify a type in a CFI operation expression.
This makes it unusable for registers that are larger than the generic
type. However, <i>expression(E)</i> can be used to create an implicit
location description of any size.</p>

<p>A Common Information Entry (CIE) holds information that is shared among many

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">length</span></code> (initial length)</p>
<p>A constant that gives the number of bytes of the CIE structure, not
including the length field itself. The size of the length field plus the

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_CFA_expression</span></code></p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_CFA_expression</span></code> instruction takes two operands: an unsigned LEB128
value representing a register number R, and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">DW_FORM_block</span></code> value
representing a DWARF operation expression E. The required action is to
change the rule for the register specified by R to be an
<i>expression(E)</i> rule.</p>
<p><i>That is, E computes the location description where the register value can
be retrieved.</i></p>
<p><i>See <a class="reference internal" href="#a-6-4-2-call-frame-instructions">6.4.2 Call Frame Instructions</a> regarding
