<span id="id1"></span><h1>LLVM Community Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#llvm-community-code-of-conduct" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The LLVM community has always worked to be a welcoming and respectful
community, and we want to ensure that doesn’t change as we grow and evolve. To
that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#be-friendly-and-patient">be friendly and patient</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#be-welcoming">be welcoming</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#be-considerate">be considerate</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#be-respectful">be respectful</a>,</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#be-careful-in-the-words-that-you-choose-and-be-kind-to-others">be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others</a>, and</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#when-we-disagree-try-to-understand-why">when we disagree, try to understand why</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to communicate
and participate in the community.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the LLVM project or The
LLVM Foundation. This includes Discord channels, mailing lists, bug trackers,
LLVM events such as the developer meetings and socials, and any other forums
created by the project that the community uses for communication. It applies to
all of your communication and conduct in these spaces, including emails, chats,
things you say, slides, videos, posters, signs, or even t-shirts you display in
these spaces.</p>
<p>In rare cases, violations of this code outside of these spaces may affect a
person’s ability to participate within these spaces. Important examples
include <a class="reference external" href="https://hr.un.org/sites/hr.un.org/files/SEA%20Glossary%20%20%5BSecond%20Edition%20-%202017%5D%20-%20English_0.pdf">sexual and gender-based violence</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://hatecrime.osce.org">hate crimes</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/UN%20Strategy%20and%20Plan%20of%20Action%20on%20Hate%20Speech%2018%20June%20SYNOPSIS.pdf">hate speech</a>.
We do not conduct proactive research, but we have an obligation to respond
to any reported concerns. We are not interested in evaluating severity,
responding punitively, or holding people accountable. Both the relevance
and our response is instead focused on how a person’s continued participation
impacts the community’s safety, wellbeing, and inclusivity. We specifically
prioritize remaining a welcoming community to victims as well as groups
subjected to systemic marginalization or underrepresentation.</p>
<p>In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may, in rare
cases, affect a person’s ability to participate within them, when the conduct
amounts to an egregious violation of this code.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing <a class="reference external" href="mailto:conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;llvm&#46;org">conduct<span>&#64;</span>llvm<span>&#46;</span>org</a>. For more details please see the
<a class="reference internal" href="ReportingGuide.html"><span class="doc">Reporting Guide</span></a>.</p>
<ul class="simple" id="be-friendly-and-patient">
<li><p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" id="be-welcoming">
<li><p><strong>Be welcoming.</strong> We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited
to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
political belief, religion or lack thereof, and mental and physical ability.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" id="be-considerate">
<li><p><strong>Be considerate.</strong> Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember
that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in
someone else’s primary language.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" id="be-respectful">
<li><p><strong>Be respectful.</strong> Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the LLVM
community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as
with people outside the LLVM community.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul id="be-careful-in-the-words-that-you-choose-and-be-kind-to-others">
<li><p><strong>Be careful in the words that you choose and be kind to others.</strong> Do not
insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</p></li>
<li><p>Discriminatory jokes and language.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying
information (“doxing”).</p></li>
<li><p>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Unwelcome sexual attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop. Persisting in such
behavior after being asked to stop is considered harassment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple" id="when-we-disagree-try-to-understand-why">
<li><p><strong>When we disagree, try to understand why.</strong> Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and LLVM is no exception. It is important that
we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that
we’re different. The strength of LLVM comes from its varied community, people
from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds
a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to
err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping
to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="reporting">
<h2>Reporting<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct you can always report
it to the LLVM Foundation Code of Conduct Committee by emailing
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;llvm&#46;org">conduct<span>&#64;</span>llvm<span>&#46;</span>org</a>. All reports will be kept confidential. This isn’t a public
list and only members of the advisory committee will receive the report. For
details on what to include in the report, please see the <a class="reference internal" href="ReportingGuide.html"><span class="doc">Reporting Guide</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.</p>
<p>If the violation occurs at an event such as a Developer Meeting and requires
immediate attention, you can also reach out to any of the event organizers or
staff. Event organizers and staff will be prepared to handle the incident and
able to help. If you cannot find one of the organizers, the venue staff can
locate one for you. We will also post detailed contact information for specific
events as part of each events’ information. In person reports will still be
kept confidential exactly as above, but also feel free to (anonymously if
needed) email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;llvm&#46;org">conduct<span>&#64;</span>llvm<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>

<section id="bans">
<h2>Bans<a class="headerlink" href="#bans" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The code of conduct committee may decide to ban an individual from the
community for violating the code of conduct. The goal of a ban is to protect
community members from having to interact with people who are consistently not
respecting the code of conduct. Please refer to the
<a class="reference internal" href="DeveloperPolicy.html"><span class="doc">Developer Policy</span></a> section on Bans for how to handle
interactions with former community members. If you need further guidance,
please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:conduct&#37;&#52;&#48;llvm&#46;org">conduct<span>&#64;</span>llvm<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>
