<h1><span class="section-number">3.5. </span>Region Store<a class="headerlink" href="#region-store" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The analyzer “Store” represents the contents of memory regions. It is an opaque
functional data structure stored in each <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ProgramState</span></code>; the only class that
can modify the store is its associated StoreManager.</p>
<p>Currently (Feb. 2013), the only StoreManager implementation being used is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RegionStoreManager</span></code>. This store records bindings to memory regions using a
“base region + offset” key. (This allows <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*p</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p[0]</span></code> to map to the same
location, among other benefits.)</p>
<p>Regions are grouped into “clusters”, which roughly correspond to “regions with
the same base region”. This allows certain operations to be more efficient,
such as invalidation.</p>
<p>Regions that do not have a known offset use a special “symbolic” offset. These
keys store both the original region, and the “concrete offset region” – the
last region whose offset is entirely concrete. (For example, in the expression
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo.bar[1][i].baz</span></code>, the concrete offset region is the array <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo.bar[1]</span></code>,
since that has a known offset from the start of the top-level <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> struct.)</p>
<section id="binding-invalidation">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.5.1. </span>Binding Invalidation<a class="headerlink" href="#binding-invalidation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Supporting both concrete and symbolic offsets makes things a bit tricky. Here’s
an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-cpp notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After the third assignment, nothing can be said about the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[0]</span></code>,
because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i]</span></code> may have overwritten it! Thus, <em>binding to a region with a
symbolic offset invalidates the entire concrete offset region.</em> We know
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i]</span></code> is somewhere within <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>, so we don’t have to invalidate
anything else, but we do have to be conservative about all other bindings within
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>.</p>
<p>Continuing the example:</p>
<div class="highlight-cpp notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After this latest assignment, nothing can be said about the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i]</span></code>,
because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[0]</span></code> may have overwritten it! <em>Binding to a region R with a
concrete offset invalidates any symbolic offset bindings whose concrete offset
region is a super-region **or*</em> sub-region of R.* All we know about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i]</span></code>
is that it is somewhere within <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>, so changing <em>anything</em> within <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>
might change <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i]</span></code>, and changing <em>all</em> of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> (or its base region) will
<em>definitely</em> change <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i]</span></code>.</p>
<p>This logic could be improved by using the current constraints on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code>, at the
cost of speed. The latter case could also be improved by matching region kinds,
i.e. changing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[0].a</span></code> is unlikely to affect <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[i].b</span></code>, no matter what
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code> is.</p>
<p>For more detail, read through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RegionStoreManager::removeSubRegionBindings</span></code> in

<h2><span class="section-number">3.5.2. </span>ObjCIvarRegions<a class="headerlink" href="#objcivarregions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Objective-C instance variables require a bit of special handling. Like struct
fields, they are not base regions, and when their parent object region is
invalidated, all the instance variables must be invalidated as well. However,
they have no concrete compile-time offsets (in the modern, “non-fragile”
runtime), and so cannot easily be represented as an offset from the start of
the object in the analyzer. Moreover, this means that invalidating a single
instance variable should <em>not</em> invalidate the rest of the object, since unlike
struct fields or array elements there is no way to perform pointer arithmetic
to access another instance variable.</p>
<p>Consequently, although the base region of an ObjCIvarRegion is the entire
object, RegionStore offsets are computed from the start of the instance
variable. Thus it is not valid to assume that all bindings with non-symbolic
offsets start from the base region!</p>
</section>
<section id="region-invalidation">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.5.3. </span>Region Invalidation<a class="headerlink" href="#region-invalidation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Unlike binding invalidation, region invalidation occurs when the entire
contents of a region may have changed—say, because it has been passed to a
function the analyzer can model, like memcpy, or because its address has
escaped, usually as an argument to an opaque function call. In these cases we
need to throw away not just all bindings within the region itself, but within
its entire cluster, since neighboring regions may be accessed via pointer
arithmetic.</p>
<p>Region invalidation typically does even more than this, however. Because it
usually represents the complete escape of a region from the analyzer’s model,
its <em>contents</em> must also be transitively invalidated. (For example, if a region
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span></code> of type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">int</span> <span class="pre">**</span></code> is invalidated, the contents of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*p</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">**p</span></code> may
have changed as well.) The algorithm that traverses this transitive closure of
accessible regions is known as ClusterAnalysis, and is also used for finding
all live bindings in the store (in order to throw away the dead ones). The name
“ClusterAnalysis” predates the cluster-based organization of bindings, but
refers to the same concept: during invalidation and liveness analysis, all
bindings within a cluster must be treated in the same way for a conservative
model of program behavior.</p>

<section id="default-bindings">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.5.4. </span>Default Bindings<a class="headerlink" href="#default-bindings" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most bindings in RegionStore are simple scalar values – integers and pointers.
These are known as “Direct” bindings. However, RegionStore supports a second
type of binding called a “Default” binding. These are used to provide values to
all the elements of an aggregate type (struct or array) without having to
explicitly specify a binding for each individual element.</p>
<p>When there is no Direct binding for a particular region, the store manager
looks at each super-region in turn to see if there is a Default binding. If so,
this value is used as the value of the original region. The search ends when
the base region is reached, at which point the RegionStore will pick an
appropriate default value for the region (usually a symbolic value, but
sometimes zero, for static data, or “uninitialized”, for stack variables).</p>

<span class="w">                    </span><span class="c1">// Is there a Default binding for the entire array?</span>
<span class="w">                    </span><span class="c1">// There is not, but it is a stack variable, so we use</span>

<span class="w">                    </span><span class="c1">// diagnostic!).</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>NOTE: The fact that bindings are stored as a base region plus an offset limits
the Default Binding strategy, because in C aggregates can contain other
aggregates. In the current implementation of RegionStore, there is no way to
distinguish a Default binding for an entire aggregate from a Default binding
for the sub-aggregate at offset 0.</p>

<section id="lazy-bindings-lazycompoundval">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.5.5. </span>Lazy Bindings (LazyCompoundVal)<a class="headerlink" href="#lazy-bindings-lazycompoundval" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>RegionStore implements an optimization for copying aggregates (structs and
arrays) called “lazy bindings”, implemented using a special SVal called
LazyCompoundVal. When the store is asked for the “binding” for an entire
aggregate (i.e. for an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion), it returns a
LazyCompoundVal instead. When this value is then stored into a variable, it is
bound as a Default value. This makes copying arrays and structs much cheaper
than if they had required memberwise access.</p>
<p>Under the hood, a LazyCompoundVal is implemented as a uniqued pair of (region,
store), representing “the value of the region during this ‘snapshot’ of the
store”. This has important implications for any sort of liveness or
reachability analysis, which must take the bindings in the old store into
account.</p>
<p>Retrieving a value from a lazy binding happens in the same way as any other
Default binding: since there is no direct binding, the store manager falls back
to super-regions to look for an appropriate default binding. LazyCompoundVal
differs from a normal default binding, however, in that it contains several
different values, instead of one value that will appear several times. Because
of this, the store manager has to reconstruct the subregion chain on top of the
LazyCompoundVal region, and look up <em>that</em> region in the previous store.</p>
<p>Here’s a concrete example:</p>
