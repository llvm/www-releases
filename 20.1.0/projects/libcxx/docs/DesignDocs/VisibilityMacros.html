<p>Libc++ uses various “visibility” macros in order to provide a stable ABI in
both the library and the headers. These macros work by changing the
visibility and inlining characteristics of the symbols they are applied to.</p>
<p>The std namespace also has visibility attributes applied to avoid having to
add visibility macros in as many places. Namespace std has default
type_visibility to export RTTI and other type-specific information. Note that
type_visibility is only supported by Clang, so this doesn’t replace
type-specific attributes. The only exception are enums, which GCC always gives
default visibility, thus removing the need for any annotations.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_HIDDEN</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a symbol as hidden so it will not be exported from shared libraries.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_EXPORTED_FROM_ABI</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a symbol as being part of our ABI. This includes functions that are part
of the libc++ library, type information and other symbols. On Windows,
this macro applies <cite>dllimport</cite>/<cite>dllexport</cite> to the symbol, and on other
platforms it gives the symbol default visibility.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_OVERRIDABLE_FUNC_VIS</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a symbol as being exported by the libc++ library, but allow it to be
overridden locally. On non-Windows, this is equivalent to <cite>_LIBCPP_FUNC_VIS</cite>.
This macro is applied to all <cite>operator new</cite> and <cite>operator delete</cite> overloads.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Behavior</strong>: Any symbol marked <cite>dllimport</cite> cannot be overridden
locally, since <cite>dllimport</cite> indicates the symbol should be bound to a separate
DLL. All <cite>operator new</cite> and <cite>operator delete</cite> overloads are required to be
locally overridable, and therefore must not be marked <cite>dllimport</cite>. On Windows,
this macro therefore expands to <cite>__declspec(dllexport)</cite> when building the
library and has an empty definition otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a function as not being part of the ABI of any final linked image that
uses it.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI_AFTER_V1</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a function as being hidden from the ABI (per <cite>_LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI</cite>)
when libc++ is built with an ABI version after ABI v1. This macro is used to
maintain ABI compatibility for symbols that have been historically exported
by libc++ in v1 of the ABI, but that we don’t want to export in the future.</p>
<p>This macro works as follows. When we build libc++, we either hide the symbol
from the ABI (if the symbol is not part of the ABI in the version we’re
building), or we leave it included. From user code (i.e. when we’re not
building libc++), the macro always marks symbols as internal so that programs
built using new libc++ headers stop relying on symbols that are removed from
the ABI in a future version. Each time we release a new stable version of the
ABI, we should create a new _LIBCPP_HIDE_FROM_ABI_AFTER_XXX macro, and we can
use it to start removing symbols from the ABI after that stable version.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_TEMPLATE_VIS</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a type’s typeinfo and vtable as having default visibility.
This macro has no effect on the visibility of the type’s member functions.</p>
<p><strong>GCC Behavior</strong>: GCC does not support Clang’s <cite>type_visibility(…)</cite>
attribute. With GCC the <cite>visibility(…)</cite> attribute is used and member
functions are affected.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Behavior</strong>: DLLs do not support dllimport/export on class templates.
The macro has an empty definition on this platform.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_EXTERN_TEMPLATE_TYPE_VIS</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark the member functions, typeinfo, and vtable of the type named in
an extern template declaration as being exported by the libc++ library.
This attribute must be specified on all extern class template declarations.</p>
<p>This macro is used to override the <cite>_LIBCPP_TEMPLATE_VIS</cite> attribute
specified on the primary template and to export the member functions produced
by the explicit instantiation in the dylib.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Behavior</strong>: <cite>extern template</cite> and <cite>dllexport</cite> are fundamentally
incompatible <em>on a class template</em> on Windows; the former suppresses
instantiation, while the latter forces it. Specifying both on the same
declaration makes the class template be instantiated, which is not desirable
inside headers. This macro therefore expands to <cite>dllimport</cite> outside of libc++
but nothing inside of it (rather than expanding to <cite>dllexport</cite>); instead, the
explicit instantiations themselves are marked as exported. Note that this
applies <em>only</em> to extern <em>class</em> templates. Extern <em>function</em> templates obey
regular import/export semantics, and applying <cite>dllexport</cite> directly to the
extern template declaration (i.e. using <cite>_LIBCPP_FUNC_VIS</cite>) is the correct
thing to do for them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_CLASS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_VIS</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark the member functions, typeinfo, and vtable of an explicit instantiation
of a class template as being exported by the libc++ library. This attribute
must be specified on all class template explicit instantiations.</p>
<p>It is only necessary to mark the explicit instantiation itself (as opposed to
the extern template declaration) as exported on Windows, as discussed above.
On all other platforms, this macro has an empty definition.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>_LIBCPP_METHOD_TEMPLATE_IMPLICIT_INSTANTIATION_VIS</strong></dt><dd><p>Mark a symbol as hidden so it will not be exported from shared libraries. This
is intended specifically for method templates of either classes marked with
<cite>_LIBCPP_TYPE_VIS</cite> or classes with an extern template instantiation
declaration marked with <cite>_LIBCPP_EXTERN_TEMPLATE_TYPE_VIS</cite>.</p>
<p>When building libc++ with hidden visibility, we want explicit template
instantiations to export members, which is consistent with existing Windows
behavior. We also want classes annotated with <cite>_LIBCPP_TYPE_VIS</cite> to export
their members, which is again consistent with existing Windows behavior.
Both these changes are necessary for clients to be able to link against a
libc++ DSO built with hidden visibility without encountering missing symbols.</p>
<p>An unfortunate side effect, however, is that method templates of classes
either marked <cite>_LIBCPP_TYPE_VIS</cite> or with extern template instantiation
declarations marked with <cite>_LIBCPP_EXTERN_TEMPLATE_TYPE_VIS</cite> also get default
visibility when instantiated. These methods are often implicitly instantiated
inside other libraries which use the libc++ headers, and will therefore end up
being exported from those libraries, since those implicit instantiations will
receive default visibility. This is not acceptable for libraries that wish to
control their visibility, and led to PR30642.</p>
<p>Consequently, all such problematic method templates are explicitly marked
either hidden (via this macro) or inline, so that they don’t leak into client
libraries. The problematic methods were found by running
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/smeenai/bad-visibility-finder">bad-visibility-finder</a>
against the libc++ headers after making <cite>_LIBCPP_TYPE_VIS</cite> and
<cite>_LIBCPP_EXTERN_TEMPLATE_TYPE_VIS</cite> expand to default visibility.</p>
