<h1>LLVM Security Group Transparency Reports<a class="headerlink" href="#llvm-security-group-transparency-reports" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This page lists the yearly LLVM Security Response group transparency reports.</p>
<p>The LLVM Security Response group started out as the LLVM security group, previous
year’s transparency reports keep the original name.</p>
<p>Initially the Chromium issue tracker was used to record issues. This
component has been archived and is read-only. A GitHub
llvm/llvm-project issue has been created for each issue in the
Chromium issue tracker. All of these issues contain an attached PDF
with the content of the Chromium issue, and have the SecurityArchive
label.</p>
<p>Each Chromium issue has 3 URLs, the first is the original URL recorded in
previous transparency reports. The second is the redirect URL to the archive.
The third is to the GitHub archive issue.</p>

<h2>2021<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="Security.html"><span class="doc">LLVM security group</span></a> was established on the 10th of July
2020 by the act of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/7bf73bcf6d93">initial
commit</a> describing
the purpose of the group and the processes it follows.  Many of the group’s
processes were still not well-defined enough for the group to operate well.
Over the course of 2021, the key processes were defined well enough to enable
the group to operate reasonably well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We defined details on how to report security issues, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/c9dbaa4c86d2">this commit on
20th of May 2021</a></p></li>
<li><p>We refined the nomination process for new group members, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/4c98e9455aad">this
commit on 30th of July 2021</a></p></li>
<li><p>We started writing an annual transparency report (you’re reading the 2021
report here).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of 2021, we had 2 people leave the LLVM Security group and 4
people join.</p>
<p>In 2021, the security group received 13 issue reports that were made publicly
visible before 31st of December 2021.  The security group judged 2 of these
reports to be security issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>original: <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=5">https://bugs.chromium.org/p/llvm/issues/detail?id=5</a>

</ul>
<p>Both issues were addressed with source changes: #5 in clangd/vscode-clangd, and
#11 in llvm-project.  No dedicated LLVM release was made for either.</p>
<p>We believe that with the publishing of this first annual transparency report,
the security group now has implemented all necessary processes for the group to
operate as promised. The group’s processes can be improved further, and we do
expect further improvements to get implemented in 2022. Many of the potential
improvements end up being discussed on the <a class="reference external" href="https://llvm.org/docs/GettingInvolved.html#online-sync-ups">monthly public call on LLVM’s
security group</a>.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the first half of 2024, LLVM used the Chromium issue tracker to enable
reporting security issues responsibly. We switched over to using GitHub’s
“privately reporting a security vulnerability” workflow in the middle of 2024.</p>
<p>In previous years, our transparency reports were shorter, since the full
discussion on a security ticket in the Chromium issue tracker is fully visible
once disclosed. This is not the case with issues using GitHub’s security
advisory workflow, so instead we give a longer description in this transparency
report, to make the relevant information on the ticket publicly available.</p>
<p>This transparency report doesn’t necessarily mention all issues that were deemed
duplicates of other issues, or tickets only created to test the bug tracking
system.</p>

GHSA-mr8r-vvrc-w6rq <br/>
The .git directory was accessible via web browsers under apt.llvm.org, a site
used to serve Debian/Ubuntu nightly packages. This issue has been addressed
by removing the directory, and is not considered a security issue for the
compiler. The .git directory was an artifact of the CI job that maintained
the apt website, and was mirroring an open-source project maintained on
github (under opencollab/llvm-jenkins.debian.net). The issue is not believed
to have leaked any non-public information.</p></li>
<li><p>“llvm/llvm-project repo potentially vulnerable to GITHUB_TOKEN leaks” <br/>
GHSA-f5xj-84f9-mrw6 <br/>
GitHub access tokens were being leaked in artifacts generated by GitHub
Actions workflows. The vulnerability was first reported publicly as
ArtiPACKED, generally applicable to GitHub projects, leading to an audit of
LLVM projects and the reporting of this security issue. LLVM contributors
audited the workflows, found that the “release-binaries” workflow was
affected, but only exposed tokens that were ephemeral and read-only, so was
not deemed a privilege escalation concern. The workflow was fixed in a
configuration change as PR
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/106310">106310</a>. Older exposed
tokens all expired, and the issue is closed as resolved.</p></li>
<li><p>“RCE in Buildkite Pipeline” <br/>
GHSA-2j6q-qcfm-3wcx <br/>
A Buildkite CI pipeline (llvm-project/rust-llvm-integrate-prototype) allowed
Remote Code Execution on the CI runner. The pipeline automatically runs a
test job when PRs are filed on the rust-lang/rust repo, but those PRs point
to user-controlled branches that could be maliciously modified. A security
researcher reported the issue, and demonstrated it by modifying build scripts
to expose the CI runner’s internal cloud service access tokens. The issue has
been addressed with internal configuration changes by owners of the Buildkite
pipeline.</p></li>

<li><p>“Interesting bugs for bool variable in clang projects and aarch64 modes outputting inaccurate results.” <br/>
GHSA-w7qc-292v-5xh6 <br/>
The issue reported is on a source code example having undefined behaviour
(UB), somewhat similar to this: <a class="reference external" href="https://godbolt.org/z/vo4P7bPYr">https://godbolt.org/z/vo4P7bPYr</a>.
Therefore, this issue was closed as not a security issue in the compiler. <br/>
As part of the analysis on this issue, it was deemed useful to document this
example of UB and similar cases to help users of compilers understand how UB
in source code can lead to security issues. <br/>
We concluded that probably the best option to do so is to create a regular
public issue at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues</a>, with the same
title as the security issue, and to attach a PDF (which should easily be
created using a “print-to-pdf” method in the browser) containing all
comments. Such public tickets probably need some consistent way to indicate
they come from security issues that after analysis were deemed to be outside
the LLVM threat model or weren’t accepted as a
needs-resolution-work-in-private security issue for other reasons. The LLVM
Security Response group has so far not taken action to progress this idea. <br/>
There was also a suggestion of potentially adding a short section in
<a class="reference external" href="https://llsoftsec.github.io/llsoftsecbook/#compiler-introduced-security-vulnerabilities">https://llsoftsec.github.io/llsoftsecbook/#compiler-introduced-security-vulnerabilities</a>
that summarizes a short example showing that type aliasing UB can and is
causing security vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>“llvm-libc qsort can use very large amounts of stack if an attacker can control its input list” <br/>
GHSA-gw5j-473x-p29m <br/>
If the llvm-libc <cite>qsort</cite> function is used in a context where its input list
comes from an attacker, then the attacker can craft a list that causes
<cite>qsort</cite>’s stack usage to be linear in the size of the input array,
potentially overflowing the available memory region for the stack. <br/>
After discussion with stakeholders, including maintainers for llvm-libc, the
conclusion was that this doesn’t have to be processed as a security issue
needing coordinated disclosure. An improvement to <cite>qsort</cite>’s implementation
was implemented through pull request
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/110849">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/110849</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>“VersionFromVCS.cmake may leak secrets in released builds” <br/>
GHSA-rcw6-jqvr-fcrx <br/>
The LLVM build system may leak secrets of VCS configuration into release
builds if the user clones the repo with an https link that contains their
username and/or password. <br/>
Mitigations were implemented in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/105220">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/105220</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/57dc09341e5eef758b1abce78822c51069157869">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/57dc09341e5eef758b1abce78822c51069157869</a>.
An issue was raised to suggest one more mitigation to be implemented at
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/109030">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/109030</a>.</p></li>

<p>The LLVM security group received 5 issues which were created accidentally or
were not related to the LLVM project. The subject lines for these were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Found this in my android”</p></li>
<li><p>“[Not a new security issue] Continued discussion for GHSA-w7qc-292v-5xh6”</p></li>
<li><p>“please delete it.”</p></li>
<li><p>“Please help me to delete it.”</p></li>
<li><p>“llvm code being used in malicious hacking of network and children’s devices”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, we had 2 tickets that were created to test the setup and workflow
as part of migrating to GitHub’s “security advisory”-based reporting:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>“Test if new draft security advisory gets emailed to LLVM security group” <br/>
GHSA-82m9-xvw3-rvpv</p></li>
<li><p>“Test that a non-admin can create an advisory (no vulnerability).” <br/>
GHSA-34gr-6c7h-cc93</p></li>
